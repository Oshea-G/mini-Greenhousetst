simple mini greenhouse fit for a desk. using arduino

at the moment the greenhouse will keep the interior cooled and kept at a coded tempereature.

-If the temperature is higher than the max range of heat, the house will open the roof and turn on a small fan at the bottom. -If the temperature drops below the min range of heat, the house will close the roof and turn off the fan

other ideas not yet made, includes added a small heating system inside the interior to heat, an interface that allows the user to change the temperature settings of the greenhouse.
